I love researching and sharing newly uncovered insights.

I studied physics to learn how the world around us works, and wrote a thesis exploring connections between fluid dynamics and meteorology, the Earth's core, and the sun. I took additional courses in journalism, and interviewed college officials and dug through budgets and California State Legislation in the search for answers.

I carry this drive everywhere, including my most recent job in retail banking. During down time, I analyzed public mortgage records and financial reports to show how my employer compared to its competition.

I just finished training to be a data scientist, and now I'm ready to turn my passion into my career.
